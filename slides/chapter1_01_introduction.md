# What is a Data Frame?

A `data.frame` is basically a table-like format which has the following properties: 

- Columns can each have a different type (`numeric`, `character`, `boolean`, `factor`)
- Columns are called "variables"
- Rows correspond to a single observation (ideally)
- Can be subset or filtered based on criteria
